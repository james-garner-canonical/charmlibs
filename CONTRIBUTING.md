# Quick start

This project uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) as a task runner, backed by [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

Consider installing them both like this:

```bash
sudo snap install --classic astral-uv
uv tool install rust-just
```

Then run `just` from anywhere in the repository for usage.
