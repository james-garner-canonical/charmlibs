# Contributing to charmlibs

This monorepo contains Python libraries for [Juju](https://canonical.com/juju) charms. General libraries are defined in top-level subdirectories, and interface libraries and/or metadata are defined under the interfaces directory.

# Quick start

This project uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) as a task runner, backed by [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

Consider installing them both like this:

```bash
sudo snap install --classic astral-uv
uv tool install rust-just
```

Then run `just` or `just help` from anywhere in the repository for usage.

# Adding a new library

Run `just init` to create a new general library, or `just init --interface` for a new interface library.
We recommend following the [tutorial](https://canonical.com/juju/docs/charmlibs/tutorial) to learn how to add your library to the `charmlibs` monorepo.
If you're migrating a library that was published elsewhere, read the [how-to guide for migrating an existing library to this repository](https://canonical.com/juju/docs/charmlibs/how-to/migrate/).

# Working on an existing library

Run `just check <my package>` to run the primary checks for your package. This runs linting, unit tests, and builds the reference docs:

- `just lint <my package>` runs `ruff`, `codespell`, and `pyright` on your package.
    - `just fast-lint` runs ruff across the whole repository.
    - `just format [package]` will try to automatically fix formatting errors.
    - `just static <package>` runs pyright only.
- `just unit <my package>` runs unit tests.
- `just docs html <my package>` builds the reference docs for `<my package>` only (for speed).
    - `just docs html` or `just docs` will build docs for all packages.

## Adding dependencies

Use `just add <package> <dep>` to add a dependency to a library, rather than calling `uv add` directly. This applies repo-level version constraints from `test-requirements.txt`, keeping the lockfile consistent.

```bash
just add pathops 'pydantic>=2'
```

## Functional and integration tests

`functional` and `integration` tests are also executed in CI, and can be run locally too. They're excluded from `just check` as they may require additional setup:

- `just functional <package>` runs functional tests, which interact with real external processes (but not Juju itself). Some functional test suites may require `sudo` access and may be destructive to the local environment (e.g. installing or removing system packages). Use [Workshop](https://snapcraft.io/workshop) to run them in an isolated container instead of running them directly on your host:

  ```bash
  workshop exec resolute -- sudo just functional <package>    # Ubuntu 26.04
  workshop exec noble -- sudo just functional <package>       # Ubuntu 24.04
  workshop exec jammy -- sudo just functional <package>       # Ubuntu 22.04
  ```

  Extra pytest flags are passed through, e.g. `workshop exec noble -- sudo just functional snap -x -k test_install`. Workshop configs are in `.workshop/`.

- Integration tests involve packing real test charms and deploying them on a Juju cloud. Pack first with `just pack-k8s <package>` or `just pack-machine <package>`, then run `just integration-k8s <package>` or `just integration-machine <package>`.

# Documentation

The documentation site published at [canonical.com/juju/docs/charmlibs](https://canonical.com/juju/docs/charmlibs) is built with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) from the source in the `.docs/` directory. It combines two kinds of content:

- **Hand-written diataxis pages** (tutorials, how-to guides, and explanations) authored in `.docs/`, plus per-library pages that live in each library's own `docs/` directory.
- **Reference docs** generated automatically from your library's docstrings via Sphinx [autodoc](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html). The module docstring in your package's `__init__.py` becomes the top-level description for that library's reference page.

## Building the docs

All docs commands are exposed under the `docs` module of `just`. Run `just docs help` to list them.

```bash
just docs html <package>   # build docs, generating reference docs for <package> only (fast)
just docs html             # build everything, including reference docs for all packages
just docs                  # alias for `just docs html`
just docs html -           # build the site with no package reference docs (fastest; for editing prose only)
```

`just docs html <package>` is also run as part of `just check <package>`, so building the reference docs for your library happens automatically when you run the standard pre-commit check.

The built site is written to `.docs/_build/html` by default (or to `$READTHEDOCS_OUTPUT` in CI).

## How the build works

The build is intentionally multi-pass, because different libraries can have conflicting dependencies and we can't install them all into a single Sphinx environment:

1. **Diataxis preprocessing.** The `.docs/scripts/diataxis_preprocessor.py` script runs first. It walks every library, copies any `docs/` pages into the Sphinx source tree, and generates the `_lib-*.md` toctree include files that the category index pages pull in.
2. **Per-package reference passes.** `sphinx-build` is invoked once per package, each time with that package installed into an isolated `uvx` environment and the `package=<name>` config option set. Each pass runs autodoc against a single library and saves its resolved doctree and index information to disk. Reference warnings are suppressed during these passes because cross-references to other libraries aren't available yet.
3. **Final combined pass.** A final `sphinx-build` runs with no `package` set. It restores the per-package reference docs saved in step 2, combines them with the hand-written pages, and produces the complete HTML site (and `llms.txt`).

The logic for steps 2 and 3 lives in the local Sphinx extensions under `.docs/extensions/` (notably `package_docs.py` and `interface_docs.py`), which are registered in `.docs/conf.py`. Docs dependencies are pinned in `.docs/_dev/requirements.txt`.

## Working on the docs

To preview prose changes with live reload, use:

```bash
just docs run    # watch, build, and serve; does not rebuild package reference docs automatically
```

Other useful checks:

```bash
just docs linkcheck   # check for broken links
just docs spelling    # flag US-English misspellings not in the custom wordlist
just docs vale        # check Canonical style guide compliance (errors only)
just docs woke        # check for non-inclusive language
just docs clean       # remove files created by building the docs
```

The local Sphinx extensions have their own tests and type checks:

```bash
just docs ext-unit     # run unit tests for the local extensions
just docs ext-static   # run pyright over the local extensions
```

## Writing reference docstrings

Reference docs are generated from docstrings, so anything you write in your public API's docstrings appears verbatim in the published reference. Keep them informative for library users rather than implementation notes. When adding cross-reference sections like "Read more", use bare text (for example, ``Read more: {ref}`how-to-customize-integration-tests` ``) rather than block quotes.

For adding tutorials, how-to guides, and explanations specific to your library, see the [how-to guide for adding docs to a library](https://canonical.com/juju/docs/charmlibs/how-to/add-library-docs/).

# Pull requests

PRs are squash-merged, so your PR title becomes the single commit message that lands on `main`. Commit messages on your branch don't need to follow any particular format.

PR titles must follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). When a PR affects a single library, use the distribution package name without the leading `charmlibs-` or `charmlibs-interfaces` as the scope:

```
feat(pathops): add copytree and rmtree
chore(tls-certificates): update to Pydantic v2
```

## Versioning and releases

Libraries are automatically published to PyPI when a merged PR bumps the version to a non-dev version. Dev versions (like `1.0.0.dev0`) are excluded from the release CI, so you can safely merge in-progress work with a dev version.

Any PR that would trigger a release must also update the library's `CHANGELOG.md` — CI will block the merge otherwise.
