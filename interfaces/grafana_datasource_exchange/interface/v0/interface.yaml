summary: Share UIDs for Grafana datasources between charms.
description: |
  The `grafana_datasource_exchange` interface allows charms that generate telemetry and have a reference to the datasources where said telemetry is queriable, to share those references to other charms for correlation and cross-referencing purposes.

  This is a symmetrical relation, where implementers broadcast the same information regardless of whether they are the provider or requirer.
  To avoid constraints on integration topology, charms should implement both a requirer and provider endpoint for this interface.
