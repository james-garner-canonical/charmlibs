description: |
  The `opencti_connector` interface supports connecting an OpenCTI provider charm to one or more OpenCTI connectors.
  The provider charm specifies the expected connector type for each connector relation.
  Each requirer charm shares its OpenCTI URL (and token) for the provider to connect to.
