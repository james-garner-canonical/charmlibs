# Important Change in TLS Certificates Interface V4.8
A change in private key labeling will allow a requirer with multiple instances of the tls-certificates relation interface to have one private key per relation.

## What's Changing
- The tls-certificates-interface is changing how it labels private keys for certificate request signing (Requirer side)
- Previous pattern: `{LIBID}-private-key-{unit_number}`
- New pattern: `{LIBID}-private-key-{unit_number}-{relation_name}`

## Impact on Your Deployment
When upgrading to V4.8:
 -  The library will generate new private keys that will be stored in Juju secrets with the new labels
- This will trigger a certificate rotation process, it removes the current certificate requests and certificates and requests new certificates from the provider.

## Why This Change Was Needed
Before V4.8, charms using multiple instances of the TLS relation interface would get one private key for all instances. This occurred because:
- The previous labeling pattern didn't account for multiple interface instances
- Juju doesn't create multiple secrets with the same label for the same owner
- This affected charms requiring different certificates for different purposes (e.g., internal unit communication vs. external HTTPS) and instantiate multiple instances of the interface.
