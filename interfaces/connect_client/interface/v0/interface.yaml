summary: Interact with Kafka Connect clusters.
description: |
  The `connect_client` interface allows charms to interact with Kafka Connect clusters for connector plugin and task management.
  The provider charm manages the Kafka Connect cluster and deploys connector plugins from requirer-provided URLs, while the requirer charm manages its connectors and tasks using the provider's REST endpoints.
