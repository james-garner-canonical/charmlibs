summary: Machine-charm-specific interface for managing multiple observability-related data streams.
description: |
  The `cos_agent` interface allows machine charms to send telemetry — such as metrics, logs, dashboards, and alert rules — to Opentelemetry Colector or Grafana Agent charms.

  This interface is designed specifically for machine charms, where the requirer is typically the [grafana-agent](https://charmhub.io/grafana-agent) and the [opentelemetry-collector](https://github.com/canonical/opentelemetry-collector-operator/) subordinate charms.
