summary: Machine-charm-specific interface for managing multiple observability-related data streams.
description: |
  The `cos_agent` interface allows charms to provide several observability-related data streams at once.
  This includes metrics endpoints and various rules directories.

  This interface is designed specifically for machine charms, where the requirer is typically the [grafana-agent](https://charmhub.io/grafana-agent) subordinate charm.
