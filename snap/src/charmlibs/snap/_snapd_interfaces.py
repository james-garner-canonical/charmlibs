    Connecting an already-connected plug and slot succeeds silently.

    Args:
        plug: The plug to connect, as a ``(snap, plug)`` pair. Both parts are required:
            snapd cannot resolve a plug from the snap name alone, and treats a missing
            snap name as an error.
        slot: The slot to connect to. May be given as:

            - a ``(snap, slot)`` pair. Either part may be ``""`` to have snapd resolve it.
              An empty slot resolves to the matching slot on the plug snap.
              An ``APIError`` is raised if the slot cannot be resolved unambiguously.
              An empty snap means the system snap.
            - a bare snap name, shorthand for ``(snap, '')``.
            - ``None`` (the default), shorthand for ``('', '')``.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if any part of ``plug`` or ``slot`` is blank (whitespace only).
        NotInstalledError: if the plug snap or slot snap is not installed.
            Never raised for the system snap.
        APIError: if the plug is not fully specified (empty snap or plug name), if the named plug
            or slot does not exist, if the plug and slot interfaces do not match, or if the slot
            cannot be resolved unambiguously.
        ChangeError: if the operation fails after starting (for example, an interface hook errors).

    """Disconnect a plug from a slot.

    At least one of ``plug`` or ``slot`` must be specified. Each is a ``(snap, name)`` pair;
    unlike :func:`connect`, a bare snap name is not accepted, because snapd requires the
    plug or slot name to identify what to disconnect.

    An ``APIError`` is raised if neither side is specified or if a specified side does not
    specify the plug or slot name.

    An empty snap on either side means the system snap (mirroring :func:`connect`'s slot): for
    example ``('', 'mount-observe')`` refers to ``mount-observe`` on ``snapd``/``core``.

    Three forms are supported:

    - both ``plug`` and ``slot``: disconnect that specific plug-slot connection.
      An ``APIError`` is raised if they are not connected.
    - ``plug`` only: disconnect everything connected to that plug. No-op if nothing is connected.
    - ``slot`` only: disconnect everything connected to that slot. No-op if nothing is connected.

    Args:
        plug: The plug side, as a ``(snap, plug)`` pair. Omit to disconnect by slot only.
        slot: The slot side, as a ``(snap, slot)`` pair. Omit to disconnect by plug only.
        forget: If ``True``, also clear snapd's stored preference for this interface.
            snapd normally remembers manual changes and replays them across snap refreshes.
            An auto-connected interface you disconnect stays disconnected on refresh, while a
            manual :func:`connect` is preserved. ``forget=True`` erases that stored preference
            so the interface reverts to snapd's default auto-connection policy on the next refresh.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if any part of ``plug`` or ``slot`` is blank (whitespace only).
        NotInstalledError: if the plug snap or slot snap is not installed.
