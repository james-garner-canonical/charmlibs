        slot_snap: The name of the snap providing the slot. If omitted, snapd auto-resolves
            the slot, typically to the system snap (``snapd`` or ``core``).
        slot: The name of the slot on ``slot_snap``. If omitted, snapd auto-resolves it.

        APIError: if the plug snap or slot snap is not installed, or the named plug or slot
            does not exist. The error has an empty ``kind``; inspect ``message`` for details.

    - ``(plug_snap, plug, slot_snap[, slot])`` disconnects the plug from the slot. ``slot``
