    """Ensure the snap is installed, on the specified channel and revision.

    The action taken depends on the current state of the snap:

    - If the snap is not installed, it will be installed on the specified channel and
      revision (defaulting to the latest revision on ``latest/stable``).
    - If the snap is installed on a different channel or revision, it will be refreshed to
      the specified channel and revision.
    - If the snap already matches what was specified, it will be refreshed only if a
      revision wasn't specified and update = ``True`` (default).

    Args:
        snap: The name of the snap to install or update.
        channel: The channel to track, for example ``latest/edge``. If ``None`` (default),
            the snap is installed from ``latest/stable`` when not already installed, and an
            already-installed snap's channel is left unchanged.

            A channel that starts with a risk inherits the track an installed snap is on, so
            ensuring ``edge`` for a snap that tracks ``3.6/stable`` gives ``3.6/edge``.
        revision: The revision to install, as an int or string. If ``None`` (default), the
            latest revision on the channel is used.

            A revision isn't a pin: the next refresh of this snap, including an automatic
            one, will move it to the current revision of the channel it tracks. Use
            :func:`hold` to prevent automatic refreshes. Pass ``channel`` as well as
            ``revision`` to control which channel the snap tracks -- otherwise a newly
            installed snap tracks ``latest/stable``, whichever channel the revision was
            found on.
        classic: Permission to install or refresh a revision that requires classic confinement.
            If a snap revision requires classic confinement and ``classic`` is not true,
            a :class:`NeedsClassicError` is raised.
        update: If ``True`` (default), refresh the snap when it is already installed on the
            requested channel. If ``False``, leave an already-correct snap untouched.

            Ignored when ``revision`` is specified, since that fully determines which
            revision the snap should be on, leaving nothing to update to.

    Returns:
        A truthy value if the snap was installed or updated, or a falsy value otherwise.
        Not guaranteed to be an actual :class:`bool`.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if the snap name is empty, blank, or is not a single path segment.
        NotInStoreError: If the store has no snap by that name.
        RevisionNotAvailableError: If the revision is not available on any channel.
        NeedsClassicError: If the snap requires ``classic=True``.
        ChannelNotAvailableError: If the channel is invalid or unavailable, or if the revision
            is not available on it.
        ChangeError: If the install or refresh fails after starting (for example, a hook errors).
        Error: (or a subtype) if the snap could not be installed or refreshed for another reason.

def ensure_vitality_hint(snap: str) -> object:
    """Ensure the snap is in the system's ``resilience.vitality-hint`` list.

    The vitality hint is an ordered list of snaps whose services the kernel's out-of-memory
    (OOM) killer should spare, most important first. This function appends the snap to the end of
    the list if it is not already present.

    You can call this function before the snap is installed, and snapd will apply the hint when
    the snap is installed. If the snap is already installed, snapd rewrites the snap's
    service units straight away, and starts any services that are enabled but stopped.
    A running service keeps its current score until it next starts, so use :func:`restart`
    if you want the hint applied immediately.

    This works by setting each service's ``OOMScoreAdjust``, which ranges from -1000
    (special: never killed) to 1000, with a default of 0. Lower values mean more protection.
    When the system runs out of memory, the kernel kills the process with the highest score based
    on its share of memory (1000 * 0.1 -> 100, 1000 * 0.5 -> 500) plus its ``OOMScoreAdjust``.
    snapd sets ``OOMScoreAdjust`` to ``-900`` plus the snap's position in the list: ``-899``
    for the first snap, ``-898`` for the second, and so on, up to ``-800`` for the 100th.
    Unlisted snaps' services keep the default of ``0``, like most other processes.
    So a listed snap's service (-899 - -800) can only killed ahead of an unlisted process (0)
    if it uses memory on the order of 80-90% of the system's total memory.
    Between listed snaps, memory use differences are the more significant factor.

    Args:
        snap: The name of the snap to add to the list. A snap instance name, such as
            ``foo_bar``, may be used to target a parallel install.

    Returns:
        A truthy value if the snap was added to the list, or a falsy value if it was already
        listed. Not guaranteed to be an actual :class:`bool`.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if the snap name is empty, blank, contains a comma, has leading or
            trailing whitespace, or is "snapd" (whose services are always at ``-900``).
        ChangeError: if snapd rejects the updated list: if the snap name is not a valid snap
            name, or if the list would contain too many snaps (snapd's current limit is 100).
