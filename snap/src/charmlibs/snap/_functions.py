    """Ensure the snap is installed, on the specified channel and revision.

    The action taken depends on the current state of the snap:

    - If the snap is not installed, it will be installed on the specified channel and
      revision (defaulting to the latest revision on ``latest/stable``).
    - If the snap is installed on a different channel or revision, it will be refreshed to
      the specified channel and revision.
    - If the snap already matches what was specified, it will be refreshed only if a
      revision wasn't specified and update = ``True`` (default).

    Args:
        snap: The name of the snap to install or update.
        channel: The channel to track, for example ``latest/edge``. If ``None`` (default),
            the snap is installed from ``latest/stable`` when not already installed, and an
            already-installed snap's channel is left unchanged.

            A channel that starts with a risk inherits the track an installed snap is on, so
            ensuring ``edge`` for a snap that tracks ``3.6/stable`` gives ``3.6/edge``.
        revision: The revision to install, as an int or string. If ``None`` (default), the
            latest revision on the channel is used.

            A revision isn't a pin: the next refresh of this snap, including an automatic
            one, will move it to the current revision of the channel it tracks. Use
            :func:`hold` to prevent automatic refreshes. Pass ``channel`` as well as
            ``revision`` to control which channel the snap tracks -- otherwise a newly
            installed snap tracks ``latest/stable``, whichever channel the revision was
            found on.
        classic: Permission to install or refresh a revision that requires classic confinement.
            If a snap revision requires classic confinement and ``classic`` is not true,
            a :class:`NeedsClassicError` is raised.
        update: If ``True`` (default), refresh the snap when it is already installed on the
            requested channel. If ``False``, leave an already-correct snap untouched.

            Ignored when ``revision`` is specified, since that fully determines which
            revision the snap should be on, leaving nothing to update to.

    Returns:
        A truthy value if the snap was installed or updated, or a falsy value otherwise.
        Not guaranteed to be an actual :class:`bool`.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if the snap name is empty, blank, or is not a single path segment.
        NotInStoreError: If the store has no snap by that name.
        RevisionNotAvailableError: If the revision is not available on any channel.
        NeedsClassicError: If the snap requires ``classic=True``.
        ChannelNotAvailableError: If the channel is invalid or unavailable, or if the revision
            is not available on it.
        ChangeError: If the install or refresh fails after starting (for example, a hook errors).
        Error: (or a subtype) if the snap could not be installed or refreshed for another reason.
