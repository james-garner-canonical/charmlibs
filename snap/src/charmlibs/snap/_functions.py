    The action taken depends on the current state of the snap:

    - If the snap is installed on a different channel, it will be refreshed to the

        channel: The channel to track, for example ``latest/edge``. If ``None`` (default),

            already-installed snap's channel is left unchanged.
        classic: If ``True``, install the snap with classic confinement. Required for snaps
            that use classic confinement.
        update: If ``True`` (default), refresh the snap when it is already installed on the
