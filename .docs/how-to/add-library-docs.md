# How to add docs to a library

Each library in the charmlibs monorepo can include its own documentation — tutorials, how-to guides, and explanations — which are automatically included in this very documentation site.

This guide shows you how to add docs to your library package.

## Create the docs directory

Create a `docs/` directory in your library's root:

```text
mylib/
├── docs/
│   ├── tutorial.md
│   ├── how-to/
│   │   ├── deploy.md
│   │   └── configure.md
│   └── explanation/
│       └── architecture.md
├── src/
├── tests/
└── pyproject.toml
```

The three supported categories are:

| Category | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tutorial | `docs/tutorial.md` or `docs/tutorial.rst` | One file only |
| How-to guides | `docs/how-to/*.md` or `docs/how-to/*.rst` | Multiple files |
| Explanations | `docs/explanation/*.md` or `docs/explanation/*.rst` | Multiple files |

Only these categories are discovered. Other directories under `docs/` are ignored. Within `how-to/` and `explanation/`, only files directly in the directory are picked up — nested subdirectories are not discovered.

Each doc can be written in Markdown (`.md`) or reStructuredText (`.rst`). See the [MyST syntax guide](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/sphinx-stack/latest/reference/myst-syntax/) and the [reStructuredText syntax guide](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/sphinx-stack/latest/reference/rst-syntax/) for the available markup.

## Give each doc a title

Each doc file must start with a top-level heading:

````markdown
# Getting Started

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to ...
````

The heading text is used as the page title in the docs site, prefixed with your library name. For example, a tutorial in `pathops/docs/tutorial.md` with heading `# Getting Started` will appear as **pathops: Getting Started** in the site navigation.

## Add a meta description

Each doc should have a short meta description for search engines and link previews. In a Markdown file, add a `description` to the front matter, before the top-level heading:

````markdown
---
myst:
  html_meta:
    description: Manage files in a charm workload with pathops.
---

# Getting Started
````

In a reStructuredText file, use the `meta` directive instead:

```rst
.. meta::
   :description: Manage files in a charm workload with pathops.

Getting Started
===============
```

## Link to other docs

Use relative links to reference other files in your library or in the repo. The build system rewrites these links automatically:

- Links to other docs files (tutorials, how-to guides, explanations, or `.docs/` pages) become internal Sphinx links.
- Links to any other repo files (source code, READMEs, etc.) become GitHub links pointing to the `main` branch.

For example, from `docs/how-to/deploy.md`:

```markdown
See the [architecture overview](../explanation/architecture.md) for background.

Check the [source code](../../src/charmlibs/mylib/_impl.py) for details.
```

## Build and preview

To build the docs and verify your changes:

```bash
just docs html mylib
```

This runs the preprocessor (which copies your docs into the Sphinx source tree) and builds the site. Your docs will appear under the corresponding category pages.

Naming a package only limits which packages get their reference docs (auto)generated. The preprocessor always copies the diataxis docs for *every* package, so tutorials, how-to guides, and explanations from other libraries will still appear in the build.

To build docs for all packages:

```bash
just docs
```
