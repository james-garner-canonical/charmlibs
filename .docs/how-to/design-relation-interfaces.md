# How to design relation interfaces
% Based on: OP083 - Relation Interface Design

When designing the relation data format for a new interface, follow this high-level approach:

1. Decide what data needs to be transmitted over a relation.
2. Design the JSON representation with provisions for backward and forward compatibility.

This guide provides rules for relation data formats.

## Why is it important to follow these rules?

The interface needs to be able to evolve without causing breaking changes or downtime during application upgrades.

Relation data outlives a single charm revision: either side of the relation may be upgraded first, and the upgrade itself is not atomic. The same applies to secret content when a Juju secret is shared over a relation.

When the interface evolves, some version of the library has to support both the old and new schema, and that complexity should not leak into charm code.

## General requirements

### Charm-facing API

The relation data format is a long-lived contract, while the charm-facing library API is easier to change. Design the charm-facing API and relation data format separately from the start.

### Unit tests

Unit tests must capture the interface schema evolution. Unit tests typically also capture the charm-facing API evolution.

When the interface is modified, running unit tests against both new and old test vectors shows the charm library developer what has been extended and what has been broken.
The developer then updates the unit tests to encode the deliberate choice for how the old data is meant to be handled.

### Allowed interface changes

The only changes allowed on a published interface are:

- Adding a new field, at the top level or nested: this is a new feature that must be communicated by a minor version bump of the library.
- Removing a field: this is a backward-incompatible change, and must be clearly communicated by a major version bump of the library.
- Tweaking field validators or extending or narrowing an enumeration value range: must be done with extra care, including compatibility testing between the old and new versions of the library.

## Design the relation data format

### Fixed field types

Once a field has been declared, the type of that field must not be changed.

Field types cannot be narrowed, widened, or changed entirely, because such a field would fail to validate in either the newer or older application.

The same applies to significant changes to the range of values that a field validator accepts. For example:

- Narrowing the set of allowed protocols from any value to HTTP and HTTPS is probably a bug fix, if other protocols such as FTP could not be used by the workload.
- Extending an IP address field to accept IPv6 addresses represents a breaking change. The older remote application is likely to reject an IPv6 address, potentially making the interface unusable.
- Narrowing an IP address field by removing IPv4 addresses represents a breaking change. If the older remote application sends an IPv4 address, this side of the relation is likely to reject the value, potentially making the interface unusable.

Unexpected enumeration values should be treated as missing (deserialised as `None`) or coerced to a pre-defined catch-all `UNKNOWN` value:

```py
class FooEnum(StrEnum):
    A = "A"
    B = "B"

foo: FooEnum | None = None


class BarEnum(StrEnum):
    UNKNOWN = "UNKNOWN"
    A = "A"
    B = "B"

bar: BarEnum = BarEnum.UNKNOWN
```

The allowed field types should be validated with a unit test, for example:

```py
V1_FLOAT = {"number": 42.1}
V1_INT = {"number": 42}
V1_EMPTY = {}


def test_field_types():
    Data.model_validate(V1_FLOAT)
    Data.model_validate(V1_INT)
    Data.model_validate(V1_EMPTY)


# Note that Pydantic coerces False to 0 and "42" to 42
@pytest.mark.parametrize("bad_value", ["str", [], {}, None])
def test_invalid_field_types(bad_value: Any):
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        Data.model_validate({"number": bad_value})
```

### No mandatory fields

Top-level fields must not be mandatory. Any and all top-level fields may be absent in the relation data, and it must still parse cleanly.

This implies that the empty relation data must have a valid representation in the interface model.
In practice, use a single model for both reading and writing.
That means the writer will use the model's default values when writing the relation data.
Readers must therefore handle both representations: a field may be absent, or it may be present with the default value.

For new interfaces, prefer representing an absent field as `None`.
This keeps the model straightforward and makes the missing-value convention easy to read in both code and tests.

```py
foo: str | None = None
```

At the top level, avoid other in-domain defaults.
Top-level fields should normally use `None` to represent absence.

Likewise, most nested fields should be either not required, optional, or supplied with a schema-assigned in-domain value.

```py
role: Role | None = None
    subject: str | None = None
    session: str | None = None
```

Assign a concrete in-domain value in the schema only when the interface semantics define that value unambiguously and all implementations should treat it the same way.
This is appropriate for nested special enum-like or otherwise tightly defined cases, but should be uncommon.

Further examples of such schema-assigned values:

```py
protocol: Literal["http", "https"] = "https"
temperature: float = 0.0
priority: int = 100
sans_dns: frozenset[str] = frozenset()
```

The charm library implementation must be accompanied by unit tests that show:

- the empty relation data is parsed correctly
- data with missing values parses correctly for not-required fields
- data with `null` values parses correctly for optional fields
- any schema-assigned in-domain values are applied deliberately and consistently

```py
V1_DATABAG = {"name": "aa", "surname": "bb"}


def test_empty_databag():
    assert DataV2.model_validate({})


@pytest.mark.parametrize("field_to_remove", ["name", "surname"])
def test_missing_fields(field_to_remove):
    data = {**V1_DATABAG}
    del data[field_to_remove]
    assert DataV2.model_validate(data)
```

### No field reuse

If a field has been removed from the interface, another field with the same name must not be added. This rule exists to make field removal possible without the risk of misinterpretation when two applications from different eras are integrated.

The exception is reverting removal of a field, where the field is brought back with identical type and semantics.

Field reuse must be prevented, either by keeping a unit test after removal:

```py
V1_DATABAG = {"name": "a name", "surname": "a surname"}

def test_removed_fields():
    assert DataV2.model_validate(V1_DATABAG).name == "a name"
    assert "surname" not in DataV2.model_fields  # Removed in V2

    # alternatively
    assert DataV2.model_validate(V1_DATABAG).model_dump == {"name": "a name"}
```

Or an equivalent state transition test:

```py
def _on_relation_changed(self, event: ops.RelationChangedEvent):
    data = event.relation.load(lib.DataV2, event.app)
    assert ...

# test
data = {"name": '"a name"', "surname": '"a surname"'}
rel = testing.Relation('endpoint', remote_app_data=data)
state_in = testing.State(leader=True, relations={rel})
ctx.run(ctx.on.relation_changed(rel), state_in)
```

### Collections

Collections must be represented as arrays of objects on the wire when using the default JSON serialisation.

Collections must be emitted in a stable order, so that setting the same data does not trigger spurious relation-changed events. The order must be ignored on reception, and the recipient is expected to discard duplicates. In other words, collections are sets.

Additionally, while empty objects are technically valid, and so are objects with only unknown fields set, the recipient is expected to filter those out for lack of semantic value.

```py
class Endpoint(pydantic.BaseModel, frozen=True):
    id: str | None = None
    some_url: str | None = None


class Databag(pydantic.BaseModel):
    endpoints: frozenset[Endpoint] | None = None


# This is preferred
SAMPLE_DATABAG = {"endpoints": [
    {"id": "foo", "some_url": "//foo-path"},
    {"id": "bar", "some_url": "//bar-path"},
]}
```

The definition must be accompanied by comprehensive unit tests. A unit test may look like:

```py
DATABAG = {"foos": [
    {"foo": "a"},                   # ok
    {"strange-data": "bar"},        # filtered out
    {"foo": "b", "new-field": "d"}  # new-field dropped
]}

def test_foos():
    accepted_foos = charm_lib.parse(DATABAG).foos
    assert accepted_foos == {"a", "b"}
```

Collections of primitive types are strongly discouraged, because they are impossible to extend.

Data maps are strongly discouraged. An exception to this rule is when the data map key is a Juju entity with a well-known string representation, such as a unit name or machine ID:

```py
# This is allowed
INGRESS_PER_UNIT_DATABAG = {"ingress": {
    "recipient-app/0": {"url": "external.host:2009/"}
    "recipient-app/1": {"url": "external.host:2007/"},
    ...
}}
```

### URLs and URIs

URLs, URIs, and URI-like connection strings are encouraged.

Each URL field must be documented and tested for consistency and precision:

- what the purpose of the URL is
- what kind of URL it is, semantically
- what components are allowed
- what values are allowed for each component

A sample checklist:

- Is this a base URL, an endpoint, a full URL, an opaque identifier, or an application-specific URI or string?
- Are there limits for the URL as a whole, such as max length or allowed alphabet?
- Is the scheme required, optional or not allowed; what schemes are allowed?
- Is the userinfo required, optional or not allowed; what elements of userinfo are allowed?
- Is the host required, optional or not allowed; what kind of values: domain names, IPv4 addresses, and/or IPv6 addresses?
- Is the port required, optional or not allowed; what range of values?
- Is the path required, optional or not allowed; any restrictions on the path, such as max length?
- Is the query required, optional or not allowed; any restrictions on keys, expected treatment for duplicate keys?
- Is the fragment required, optional or not allowed; any restrictions, such as max length?

A set of unit tests that verify the allowed URLs may look like this, at minimum:

```py
@pytest.mark.parametrize("bad_url", [
    "ftp://an.example",        # unsupported scheme
    "https://1.1.1.1",         # hostnames only
    "http://user@an.example",  # credentials not allowed
    "http://an.example/#bar",  # fragment not allowed
])
def test_bad_url_field_values(bad_url: str):
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        SomeData(url_field=bad_url)

@pytest.mark.parametrize("good_url", [
    "http://an.example",
    "https://an.example",
    "http://an.example/some/path",
    "http://an.example/some/path?some=query",
])
def test_good_url_field_values(good_url: str):
    SomeData(url_field=good_url)
```

### Semantic grouping

The relation data should be structured to reflect the meaning of data, for example:

```py
# Do this:
{
    "direct": {"host": ..., "port": ...},
    "upstream": {"base_url": ..., "path": ...}
}

# Avoid this:
{
    "host": ...,
    "port": ...,
    "base_url": ...,
    "path": ...,
}
```

### Secret content schema

When a secret is shared over a relation, the secret content schema must be contained in the same charm library as the relation interface schema.

The same rules apply to the secret content:

- no mandatory fields
- no field reuse
- allowed URL or URI components

Using a state transition test, in essence:

```py
@pytest.mark.parametrize("secret_content, status", [
    (GOOD_SECRET_CONTENT, ops.ActiveStatus()),
    (BAD_SECRET_CONTENT, ops.WaitingStatus("...")),
])
def test_secret_content(secret_content: dict[str, Any], status):
    ...
    state_out = ctx.run(
        ctx.on.relation_changed(relation=rel, remote_unit=1), state_in)

    assert state_out.unit_status == status
```

[Full test code](https://github.com/dimaqq/op083-samples/blob/main/test_secret_content.py)

Or a unit test:

```py
GOOD_SECRET_CONTENT = {"secret_thing": "foo", "some_future_field": "42"}
BAD_SECRET_CONTENT = {"unknown_field": "42"}
DATABAG = {"server_uri": '"secret://42"'}

def test_good_secret(monkeypatch: pytest.MonkeyPatch):
    monkeypatch.setattr("charm_lib._load_secret", GOOD_SECRET_CONTENT)
    charm_lib.parse(DATABAG)
    assert charm_lib.get_secret_thing() == "foo"

def test_bad_secret():
    monkeypatch.setattr("charm_lib._load_secret", BAD_SECRET_CONTENT)
    charm_lib.parse(DATABAG)
    with pytest.raises(SomeCharmLibError):
        charm_lib.get_secret_thing()
```
