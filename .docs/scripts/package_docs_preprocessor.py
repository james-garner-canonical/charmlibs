"""Write placeholder rst files for every package's reference docs.

Packages are not guaranteed to have compatible dependencies, so we generate their reference docs
in separate invocations of ``sphinx-build``. Each of those builds needs a page to hang its
``automodule`` output on, and this script writes those pages.

This is a standalone preprocessor script rather than part of the companion ``package_docs``
extension. The placeholders are identical no matter which package is being built, so writing
them is a one-time preparation of the source tree rather than per-build work. Doing it once, up
front, is also what makes it safe to run the per-package builds concurrently: they share the
same source tree but never mutate each other's rst files. The ``package_docs`` extension appends
the ``automodule`` directive for the current package in memory at ``source-read`` time, so the
on-disk files stay plain placeholders.

Library packages and their testing packages (see ``package_docs`` for details) both get a
placeholder page here, cross-linked with a ``seealso`` back to each other. Where a page lives,
and how it's titled and labelled, is decided by ``package_docs._page()`` -- imported from here
rather than reimplemented, so that this script and the ``package_docs`` extension can't drift.

Run from ``just docs``; see ``docs.just`` for the invocation.
