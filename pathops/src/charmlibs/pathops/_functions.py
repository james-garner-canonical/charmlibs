    r"""Ensure ``path`` contains the text from ``transform``. Return True if any changes were made.

    ``transform`` is called exactly once with the existing contents of ``path``, or ``None`` if the
    file doesn't exist. The contents are decoded as UTF-8 and newlines are normalized to ``'\n'``.
    The result of ``transform`` is encoded as UTF-8 and written to ``path`` if the bytes differ
    from the current contents, or if ``path`` doesn't have the desired permissions and ownership.
    Like :func:`ensure_contents`, missing parent directories are created if needed.

    Newlines are handled as by :meth:`PathProtocol.read_text` and
    :meth:`PathProtocol.write_text`: ``transform`` receives the text with all newlines
    (``'\r\n'``, ``'\r'``, and ``'\n'``) translated to ``'\n'``, and the text it returns is
    written as is, so the file always ends up containing exactly the returned text. This means
    that if the file uses ``'\r\n'`` or ``'\r'`` line endings, the first call rewrites it with
    ``'\n'`` line endings (and returns ``True``), even if ``transform`` returns its input
    unchanged.

    ``transform`` is responsible for any editing policy (for example, appending a line only if
    it's not already present), and for its own idempotence. The read and the write are separate
    operations, so concurrent modification of the file between them is not detected.

    If reading, decoding, or ``transform`` raises an exception, it's propagated without the file
    being written or its metadata being changed.

    Args:
        path: A local or remote filesystem path.
        transform: Called with the existing text, or ``None`` if the file doesn't exist.
            Returns the desired text.
        mode: The desired file permissions.
        user: The desired file owner, or ``None`` to not change the owner.
        group: The desired group, or ``None`` to not change the group.

    Returns:
        ``True`` if any changes were made (including file creation, newline normalization,
        and permissions or ownership changes), otherwise ``False``.

    Raises:
        TypeError: if ``transform`` doesn't return a ``str``.
        UnicodeDecodeError: if the existing contents aren't valid UTF-8.
        LookupError: if the user or group is unknown.
        IsADirectoryError: if ``path`` is a directory.
        NotADirectoryError: if the parent exists as a non-directory file.
        PermissionError: if the user does not have permissions for the operation.
